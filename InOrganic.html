                   <p><h5> Inorganic food is produced artificially with the use of chemicals and synthetics. These popularly include pesticides, insecticides, and chemical fertilizers. The chemicals are used to increase production and avoid pests. However, these synthetics, if not used carefully, can cause adverse effects on the environment and the health of an individual. Inorganic food looks perfect with the same shape, size, and colors.</p></h5>
                     <p><h5> With the latest technology, we can make modifications as per our wish to the genes of the plants. This allows cross-breeding and the production of hybrid crops. The crops have multi-benefits at a lesser risk. This also allows production to be carried out at a larger scale. Every country has departments regulating the production of Inorganic foods. There are also restrictions on the levels of chemicals used. Inorganic foods are considered to be harmful as they are made in a conventional way. </h5></p>

                    <h6>Proponents of inorganic foods, therefore, maintain that these food items safely use modern technology to produce more cost effective food products. Many of the synthetic substances found in inorganic food items do not have long term studies available confirming the safety of these substances over time. Inorganic food is any food that has utilized synthetic products, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, in its production. Genetically modified food is also considered inorganic. The term organic food evolved from the need to differentiate between foods that have used chemical or genetic enhancers in their production and those that have not. Additionally, organic food is generally more expensive than inorganic food items. This increased cost results from the increased production costs associated with producing organic foods. Inorganic Foods use synthetics during the production process. These synthetics commonly include chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
