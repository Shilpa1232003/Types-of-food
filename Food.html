                    Humans (Homo sapiens) are the most abundant and widespread species of primate, characterized by bipedalism and large, complex brains. This has enabled the development of advanced tools, culture, and language. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. Social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, and rituals, which bolster human society. Curiosity and the human desire to understand and influence the environment and to explain and manipulate phenomena have motivated humanity's development of science, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other fields of study.Although some scientists equate the term humans with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing local populations of archaic humans. For most of history, all humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000-60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement. As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities and a number of civilizations have risen and fallen. Humans have continued to expand, with a global population of over 7.9 billion as of 2022.

               <td><p><h6>Organic food, ecological food or biological food are food and drinks produced by methods complying with the standards of organic farming. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming features practices that cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in the farming methods used to produce such products. Organic foods typically are not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents, or synthetic food additives.</h6></p>

                <td><p><h6>Inorganic Foods use synthetics during the production process. These synthetics commonly include chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Additionally, producers can also modify inorganic food items at a molecular or genetic level. This allows producers to cross-breed crops to produce hardier strains with higher quantities. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration regulates inorganic food items and determines the acceptable levels of synthetics that finished food products can contain.</h6></p></td>

            <ol>
                <li>Organic food will be completely chemical-free while inorganic food will create traces of pesticide residues which can be dangerous for human consumption.</li>
                <li>Organic food, because it is not grown using any kind of synthetic fertilizers etc, will be smaller in size as compared to Inorganic food which will grow bigger in size due to these artificial growth promoters.</li>
                <li>Organic food may also not be as shiny as its In-organic counterpart as it is not sprayed with colours, chemicals to increase the shelf life or to look fresh and beautiful.</li>
                <li>Organic food shelf life is less as there in the external coating, waxing, or colouring done.</li>
                <li>Organic vegetables and fruits may also get little worms at times inside the fruit. Where there are no Pesticides, there may be pests.</li>
                <li>The availability is limited for the organic food as currently very few number of farmers are pursuing organic farming in India and therefore logistics is a challenge.</li>
                <li>The shape of organic vegetables, fruits will be different from the other fruits or vegetables from the same tree or plant while one may find inorganic fruits to be consistent in shape, size, texture and even taste â€“ Diversity is the hallmark of organic food.</li>
                <li>Since there is no fumigation of any chemicals in storage also for Organic food, at times the dry groceries pay get some worms. There is no need to worry and one should simply put the packet in sun and the worms will go away. It just means that it is pure and chemical-free.</li>
                <li>Organic fruits, vegetables may not be available throughout the year as it is grown in sync with nature while non-organic food availability is mostly ensured round the year using artificial growth promoters and GMO seeds</li>
